# The Interactive TODO List

This project was created as part of a Week 4 challenge to demonstrate JavaScript knowledge and skills.

The goal of the challenge was to build an interactive TODO list application that allows users to manage tasks dynamically using JavaScript.

## Key features

'*' Users can add new TODO tasks to the list

'*' New tasks are displayed dynamically on the page without reloading

'*' Input validation is implemented:

    '*' If the input field is empty, an alert notifies the user:
        “Please write down your task!”

    '*' If the task already exists in the list, a prompt notifies the user:
        “This task is already in your list!”

'*' A Delete function allows users to remove tasks once they are completed
